    <h1> IN A WORLD OF ART</h1>
    <p><h2>Welcome: <br> Here you will find artwork created in my imagination with various interpretations. Have fun!</h2></p>
    <p><h4>One out of four projects for Art75. I was inspired by video history;<br>
       we learned in class. So, I decided to create a video in ode to:<br>
       JenniCam, Vito Acconci & Stomping in the studio. An intepretation.</h4> </p>

<p><h4>Installation was the second project out of four (2/4). When exhibiting a <br> piece of art as the artist we need to know how to submerge 
<br> our viewer. This idealogy is what we explored in creating this piece.<br> Ideally, I would like my piece to be viewed in VR. This way <br>
a sense of reality could be achieved just as being able to relate to the piece. Or even gain insight on <br> a new perspective.</h4>

<p><h4>3/4. One of my favorite topics, a childhood memory. I chose to re-crete a 90's page <br>
as my third project. Once I heard the idea the first memory that formed in my mind was of <br>
me using my pink flip phone. I would use it to go into MySpace or chatrooms to get to know people. <br>
So, I decided to recreate the atmosphere of a chatroom. With a little twist, a 90's chatroom.</h4></p>

<p><h4> 4/4. The last project I decided to submerge myselff into was: Net Art. I wanted to <br>
continue working on my 90's inspired site and refine the rough edges. But, <br>
at the same time I wanted to keep the simplicity of the website. I added avatars <br>
and for each conversation (link); it's a new adventure.
