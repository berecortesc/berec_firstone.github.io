  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p><h4>Welcome: <br>
          I am student-artist because I go to school while I practice art. I am currenty in the DMA program (Digital Media Art). <br>
          Since entering the DMA program I haved found myself using different mediums and as always I cannot make up my mind<br>
          about my preffered one. I know enjoy coding, but the world of art is limitless. By taking photography I have learned <br>
          there is a certain science to be a decent photropher. No, it is not aimlessly taking snapshots; it is beyon that. <br>
          In addition, I have found I really do enjoy working with my hands, getting, dirty, and creating art with. This gives <br>
          me a depper appreciation for all my body parts as well. As my art has progressed I have discovered coding is what I <br>
          enjoy, but I also like the dark side of art. I trinket with the occult and pushing bounderies within the artistic realm. <br>
          I definitely look forward to my continous exploring and to creating many more pieces. Stay tuned for may artwork. </h4></p>
